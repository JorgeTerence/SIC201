# An Intro to Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks are a way to run and document code in a single file. A notebook is a collection of blocks: note blocks (in Markdown syntax) and code blocks virtually any scripting language can have a kernel adapted to Jupyter; some of them are Python, JavaScript, Julia, Ruby or SQL.

The Jupyter Project has an official web-based front-end for your notebooks. You can access it by running `jupyter-lab` from your shell and accessing `http://localhost:8888/lab`

## Using Visual Studio Code

Through the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension, VS Code offers a nice interface for editing and running notebooks inside their IDE. Everything works just as if using the web interface - but with a arguably more slick UI ;)

A notebook is just a `.ipynb` file you can create from the Explorer menu. To select a specific interpreter (say you have a system Python, conda 'base' and conda 'your_project') click the menu at the top right corner.
