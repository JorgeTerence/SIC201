# List Comprehensions

Quite often in data analysis and processing we'll be iterating, filtering or transforming arrays, matrices etc. The first thing all of us learned was:

```python
squares = []

for i in range(1, 11):
    squares.append(i**2)
```

But Python has a special syntax that allows for expressing this kind of transformation in a much more elegant form: **comprehensions**!

```python
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1, 11)]
```

## What is going on?

It's easy to restructure a simple for loop into a comprehension:

```python
cubed_odds = []

for i in range(100):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        cubed_odds.append(i**3)
```

```python
cubed_odds = [i**3 for i in range(100) if i % 2 != 0]
```

It consists of three parts:

- `i**3`: what to return for the list element each turn. These also allow for ternary expressions.
- `for i in range(100)`: what ti iterate over.
- `if i % 2 != 0`: an optional condition to filter elements.

## Generator Expressions

Functions that accept iterators accept this special syntax - `<class 'generator'>`. The only difference is that the brackets are optional:

```python
>>> sum(i**2 for i in range(11))
385
```

## Dictionary Comprehensions

More of the same thing. The difference is that it uses braces and use the usual dictionary/hashmap syntax:

```python
>>> names = ["Vicente", "Vinicius", "Enzo"]
>>> sports = ["üèä", "üèÄ", "‚öΩ"]
>>> {name: sport for sport, name in zip(sports, names)}
{'Vicente': 'üèä', 'Vinicius': 'üèÄ', 'Enzo': '‚öΩ'}
```

## Why should I use it?

Comprehensions are the loop equivalent of the ternary operator. A full loop can sometimes be too verbose for what you want to do. But use it with caution, so your code [remains readable](https://treyhunner.com/2019/03/abusing-and-overusing-list-comprehensions-in-python)!

**Don't do this!**

```python
fizzbuzz = [
    'fizzbuzz' if n % 15 == 0
    else 'fizz' if n % 3 == 0
    else 'buzz' if n % 5 == 0
    else n
    for n in range(100)
]
```
