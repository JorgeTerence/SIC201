# Just what does `zip` do?

In Python, there's the `zip` class, which main purpose is to process multiple iterables simultaneously. This also has the interesting effect of matrix manipulation and rotation.

Let's get our hand into it; there's a list of people, with their name, age and favorite food.

```python
people = [
    ("Marin", 17, "🥗"),
    ("Bruno", 15, "🌯"),
    ("Chris", 21, "🍜"),
    ("Katie", 20, "🍪"),
]
```

What dows a zip of this look like?[^1].

```python
print(*zip(people))
```

[^1]: The spread operator

  When used before an iterable, the `*` character will _spread_ the contents of it to the arguments of a function. It's like passing each element as a positional argument.

## TL;DR

`zip` rotates a matrix.
