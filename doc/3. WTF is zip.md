# Just what does `zip` do?

In Python, there's the `zip` class, which main purpose is to process multiple iterables simultaneously. This also has the interesting effect of matrix manipulation and rotation.

Let's get our hand into it; there's a list of people, with their name, age and favorite food.

```python
people = [
    ("Marin", 17, "🥗"),
    ("Bruno", 15, "🌯"),
    ("Chris", 21, "🍜"),
    ("Katie", 20, "🍪"),
]
```

What dows a zip of this look like?[^1].

```python
>>> print(*zip(people))
(('Marin', 17, '🥗'),) (('Bruno', 15, '🌯'),) (('Chris', 21, '🍜'),) (('Katie', 20, '🍪'),)
```

Not quite what we wanted, right? Lets dig into it. The `help` article on `zip` shows it accepts any number of arguments, so we're supposed to pass them separately. Let's try using the spread operator:

```python
>>> print(*zip(*people))
('Marin', 'Bruno', 'Chris', 'Katie') (17, 15, 21, 20) ('🥗', '🌯', '🍜', '🍪')
```

That's more like it! It grouped every _column_ from `people` into a tuple. Now, try and see this: it almost like it **rotated** the entire matrix.

|       |     |     |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| Marin | 17  | 🥗  |
| Bruno | 15  | 🌯  |
| Chris | 21  | 🍜  |
| Katie | 20  | 🍪  |

⬇️

|       |       |       |       |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Marin | Bruno | Chris | Katie |
| 17    | 15    | 21    | 20    |
| 🥗    | 🌯    | 🍜    | 🍪    |

Now we can do cool things manipulating this data, like calculating the average age, order their names or plan a meal:

```python
>>> data = list(zip(*people))

>>> sum(data[1]) / 4
18.25

>>> sorted(data[0])
['Bruno', 'Chris', 'Katie', 'Marin']

>>> "".join(data[2])
'🥗🌯🍜🍪'
```

[^1]: **The spread operator**: When used before an iterable, the `*` character will _spread_ the contents of it to the arguments of a function. It's like passing each element as a positional argument.

## TL;DR

`zip` rotates a matrix.
